# Kubernauts Training Courses

---

The [Kubernauts](https://kubernauts.io/) offer free training for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Cloud Native](https://www.cncf.io) technologies.  The documents contained within this book are the living design documents for this training.  It is hoped that in combination with the community the design of the training can be shaped to best serve the needs of the community.

The Git repository where this book lives is [here](https://github.com/kubernauts/kubernauts-training-design).  Github issues can be raised to discuss and help refine the various aspects of the training.
