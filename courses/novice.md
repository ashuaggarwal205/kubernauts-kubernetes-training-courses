# **Fundamental Kubernetes Training Labs**

Our Kubernetes Fundamental Trainings takes place every 2 weeks through our [online meetup](https://www.meetup.com/kubernauts/).

The fundamental trainings slides are available [here](https://goo.gl/Hzk2sd).

## How to prepare for Kubernetes Online Trainings

For the best hands-on experience you need to [install Minikube](https://abhishek-tiwari.com/local-development-environment-for-kubernetes-using-minikube/) and create an account on GCP with billing enabled or deploy a Kubernetes Cluster with Kops on AWS.

If you haven’t a GCP account and didn’t tried Google Kubernetes Engine for free, you can quickly get started with a [$300 free credits](https://cloud.google.com/free/). Please install gcloud SDK / CLI here.

If you prefer to deploy Kubernetes on AWS, please follow our [Kops Faststart guide](https://kubernauts.gitbooks.io/kubernauts-kops-faststart/content/) or use our [TK8 installer](https://github.com/kubernauts/tk8).
