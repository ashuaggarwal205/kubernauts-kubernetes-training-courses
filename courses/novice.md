# **Fundamental Kubernetes Training Labs**

Our Kubernetes Fundamental Trainings takes place every 2 weeks through our [online meetup](https://www.meetup.com/kubernauts/).

The fundamental trainings slides are available [here](https://goo.gl/Hzk2sd).

Our Kubernetes Learning Resources are available [here](https://goo.gl/Rywkpd).

## How to prepare for our Free Kubernetes Online Trainings?

For the best hands-on learning experience you need to [install Minikube](https://abhishek-tiwari.com/local-development-environment-for-kubernetes-using-minikube/) on your local machine and create an account on GCP with billing enabled or deploy a Kubernetes Cluster with Kops on AWS or with TK8 on AWS or OpenStack.

**Note:** using GKE or installing Kubernetes on AWS or OpenStack is optional, but for some exercises where we use Loadbalancers or persistent disks a cloud installation is needed.

If you haven’t a GCP account and didn’t tried Google Kubernetes Engine for free, you can quickly get started with a [$300 free credits](https://cloud.google.com/free/). Please install gcloud SDK / CLI from [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

If you prefer to deploy Kubernetes on AWS or OpenStack, please follow our [Kops Faststart guide](https://kubernauts.gitbooks.io/kubernauts-kops-faststart/content/) or use our [TK8 installer](https://github.com/kubernauts/tk8) or the [Kubespray Essentials](https://kubernauts.gitbooks.io/kubespray-essentials/content/).
